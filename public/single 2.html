								<p>People will still do future investments even though the Cryptocurrency market is crashing off. Since they are in pretty decent demand, people who are investing in them are coming in spades. Since Crypto miners love a good graphics card, they buy cards for their crypto mining rigs, which are computer systems used for mining bitcoins. Crypto miners often have high requirements for what kind of graphics cards they use in their rigs the faster the card, the faster they can mine, so higher-end cards are more desirable. Crypto miners have entered the high-end graphics card market and show no intention of leaving anytime soon.</p>

								<p> Especially for this release of the newest graphics cards. One interesting requirement for crypto mining is at least 4GB of video RAM. Video RAM (or VRAM) is the amount of random access memory included on your graphics card. Crypto miners need to use cards with at least 4GB of video RAM in order to mine effectively, with many preferring 6-8GB for longevity and performance reasons. One effect this has had on the market is now cards with more than 4GB of video RAM have become even rarer. Even though the market is recovering from the presence of COVID-19,  the effects still perpetuate through the industry and how it even affects other things like power supply, motherboard, and laptop prices.

								<p>Even Graphics cards which cost around $200 can have an increase to $400 or even to $500 for the higher models. And shockingly the higher models like the 3080 from $600 which is honestly a fair price to a staggering $2000 (and that’s if you can find one) so pretty much the price value of these objects can go from 2% to 75%, So not only are graphics cards hard to come by thanks to organic demand, now we have increased demand thanks to Bitcoin and MSRP hikes thanks to tariffs on Chinese made goods. Now the market can’t just adapt to the increasing market share with their limited stocks. And also the insider of the industry like the chipset demand from other competitors which forces them to spew out the things, it’s not an intuitive process that usually ends in the net negative for the companies unless they raise the prices.</p>

								<p>Now it’s not the companies who have blown this out of proportion badly, it’s the 3rd party sellers and stores who have taken notice of this. Not to mention this also makes the supply and demand thing more prominent, Now this isn’t even mentioning the other prices fluctuating like laptops. Now since they have integrated GPUs inside them by logic the prices would rise, not to mention the CPU rise and everything else. The normal laptop with an integrated GPU would be priced at $900 to $2000 range for the entry and mid-ranged ones but the market can raise it to about $2500+ which is a huge gap in price since I’ve also felt this price high itself now all these problems are caused from tariff’s now since chipset production is usually built in other countries tariffs’ can happen and this can also contribute to the terrible pricing especially if the production is coming from China.
								 </p>

								<p>Real Madrid president Florentino Perez had claimed it would "save football", at a time when young people are "no longer interested" because of "a lot of poor quality games". The founding clubs were promised a share of a €3.5bn (£3bn) grant, provided by investment bank JP Morgan. Most are in considerable debt, made worse by the Covid pandemic, due to disrupted fixtures and a lack of spectators. Big clubs also have superstar players with multi-million pound salaries. If they could guarantee taking part in a major European football competition every year, they would have become more valuable and stable businesses.</p>

								<p>Now with all these issues, even though it dumbed down a bit, it is still a problem in consideration of making a PC rig or getting a laptop for either gaming or recreational activities. Therefore, it is suggested you wait it out until things lessened down. In the meantime, investing in something that can crash instantly isn’t a very affordable endeavour, especially when the prices go up and down drastically.</p>
