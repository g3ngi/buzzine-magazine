								<h1>Indonesia submarine search feared to have failed as the oxygen runs out</h1>

								<p>Indonesian rescue teams are in fear due to the worst-case scenario, an oxygen supply went missing on an Indonesian naval submarine and are thought to have run out. The debris found near the waters where Nanggala was missing has confirmed the worst fear of Indonesia's search and rescue team that the German-made diesel-powered submarine was sunk off the coast of Bali, Admiral Yudo Margono, the chief of staff of the Indonesian said on Saturday. </p>

								<p>The admiral said the search and rescue team found submarine components, including torpedo tube straighteners, coolant pipes, a bottle of periscope lubricating oil, heat-retaining sponges, and other pieces that only could have come from the submarine. search assets identified a “high magnetic” force object floating 160-320 feet below sea level as well as an oil spillage near the submarine’s last known location, raising the prospect of finding the vessel. Further investigation and rescue efforts near the area KRI Naggala-402 went missing after trying to fire its torpedoes during a combat exercise on Wednesday. The submarine last known position was in the waters over 700 meters deep, more than its maximum safe operation depth envelope of 250 to 500 meters. The debris’ identification meant Indonesia would wind down its three-day search for the 44-year-old undersea vessel that lost contact on April 21 during a military exercise, after requesting permission to dive and conduct a torpedo drill. The cause of the sinking remains elusive. Indonesian naval officials suggest an electrical failure prevented the submarine from executing emergency procedures.
								</p>

								<p>All 53 crew members on board a sunken Indonesian submarine have been confirmed dead, with the debris of the vessel found, said Indonesia's military chief on Sunday (Apr 25).</p>

								<p>Navy officials said they had received signals from the sub's location more than 800m (2,600ft) deep early on Sunday. An underwater rescue vehicle loaned by Singapore was sent down to get visual confirmation of the wreckage. The military showed what it said was a submarine escape suit found by search teams. Navy chief Admiral Yudo Margono said the suit would normally be stored in an "emergency box". He suggested that someone had perhaps taken the suit out of the box but did not manage to wear it. In a statement on Sunday, President Joko Widodo said: "This tragedy shocked us all. Not only the families of the 53 crew members and the navy but also the entire Indonesia people." "We all, the people of Indonesia, would like to convey our sadness ... especially to the families. They are the best sons of Indonesia, the best patriots.” At least six warships, a helicopter and 400 people have since been involved in the search. Singapore and Malaysia have dispatched ships to the area, and Australia, France and Germany have also offered assistance.</p>

								<p>A missing Indonesian submarine has been found, broken into at least three parts, at the bottom of the Bali Sea Navy chief of staff Yudo Margono said the crew were not to blame for the accident and that the submarine did not experience a blackout, blaming "forces of nature". "The KRI Nanggala is divided into three parts, the hull of the ship, the stern of the ship, and the main parts are all separated, with the main part found cracked," he said. "There are scattered parts of the submarine and its interior in the water.” The navy previously said an electrical failure could have left the submarine unable to execute emergency procedures to resurface. But Admiral Margono said on Sunday he wasn't sure about a possible blackout as the cause, because he said during the diving process all the lights were still on. "This means that the power was not immediately lost when diving," he said. However, he said to determine the exact cause, they will investigate the remaining parts of the submarine. </p>
