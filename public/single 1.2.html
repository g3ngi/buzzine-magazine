								<h1>2020-2021 NBA Season Award Predictions</h1>
								<ul class="details">
									<li>Posted on 7 May, 2021</li>

								<p>In just a couple of month the NBA awards will be announce and the NBA staff and character around the NBA and also the fan always picking what is the choice of the awards which is containing: Most Valuable Player (MVP), Defensive Player Of The Year (DPOY), Most Improved Player (MIP), Six Man Of The Year (6MOY), and the Coach Of The Year (COY). So in this article we will discuss who is deserving of the reward.
								</p>
								
								<h2 style="text-align:center;">MOST VALUABLE PLAYER</h2>
								<h2 style="text-align:center;">Nikola Jokic</h2>
								<div class="featured">
									<figure>
										<img src="images/TDP-L-NUGGETS-GRIZZLIES-_ADO2831X.jpg">
										<figcaption>Runner up: Joel Embiid, Chris Paul</figcaption>
									</figure>
								</div>

								<p>The reason we pick Nikola Jokic as the MVP of the 2020-2021 season because the stats tell the whole picture, Nikola Jokic or fans known him by “The Joker” is averaging 26.2 points 10.9 rebounds 8.5 Assist as a center and don’t forget that he almost average 50-40-90 as a center which is impressive cause a lot of center cannot be reliable at the three which we usually call it “modern big man”. Also this year the joker already has 15 triple double as we make this article which is rare to have the vision of a guard, so that is our MVP for this year. </p>

								<h2 style="text-align:center;">DEFENSIVE PLAYER OF THE YEAR</h2>
								<h2 style="text-align:center;">Ben Simmonds</h2>
								<div class="featured">
									<figure>
										<img src="images/Ben-Simmons-9.png">
										<figcaption>Runner up: Rudy Gobert, Bam Adebayo</figcaption>
									</figure>
								</div>

								<p>People will disagree with our pick with ben simmons but actually there are a deeper meaning why Ben Simmons is our DPOY. With just a modest 14.5 points 7.4 rebounds 6.9 assist 1.6 steal and 0.7 block, people say this award is always depend on the stats but we disagree and next is our opinion on the DPOY. Ben Simmons is a 6’11” point guard and he is the tallest guard in the NBA, which he can the position Between Guard to center which making him a thread. With the weight of 240 pound he cannot be bullied in the paint and his quick defensive IQ which making him a elite perimeter defender and with the number of steal making him our DPOY for this year. </p>

								<h2 style="text-align:center;">MOST IMPROVED PLAYER</h2>
								<h2 style="text-align:center;">Julius Randle</h2>
								<div class="featured">
									<figure>
										<img src="images/0f0adef91e176327eefe692d27f2bd6d.png">
										<figcaption>Runner up: Jerami Grant, Christian Wood</figcaption>
									</figure>
								</div>

								<p>People think Julius Randle is a “bust” because of last year performance and people has made their choice that he will never be a star, but this year Julius Randle has step up his game because of his new work ethic that he learn from Kobe Bryant when he still with the Lakers. With his new reform mindset he is currently averaging 24.2 points 10.3 rebounds and 5.9 assists, and most surprising aspect is his the number of three pointer his making this year, last year he only making 1 three pointer per game and shooting 27.7% from deep which is below average NBA player and now his 2.3 attempt per game making an efficient 42.2% from deep. Don’t forget that this year he is an all star making his debut as a “knicks”, so that’s why Julius Randle is our MIP.
								 </p>

								<h2 style="text-align:center;">SIX MAN OF THE YEAR</h2>
								<h2 style="text-align:center;">Jordan Clarkson</h2>
								<div class="featured">
									<figure>
										<img src="images/30nba-clarkson2-articleLarge.png">
										<figcaption>Runner up: Montrezl Harrell, Goran Dragic</figcaption>
									</figure>
								</div>

								<p>People already think that is Jordan Clarkson already lock himself as the unanimous 6MOY cause of his performance and impacting the late success of the Utah Jazz. With the number of 17.4 points 4 rebounds and 2.3 assist with only just 26 minutes per game with making him a force of scoring of the bench for the Utah Jazz with the number if he play 36 minutes per game and making him a 24 points per game which making him an elite scorer in the NBA, the impact of him in the team is they are the best team off the bench and fighting the phoenix suns for the number one seat in the west and that’s why he is our and majority fans six man of the year.</p>

								<h2 style="text-align:center;">Lamelo Ball</h2>
								<div class="featured">
									<figure>
										<img src="images/B1.png">
										<figcaption>Runner up: Anthony Edward, Tyrese Haliburton</figcaption>
									</figure>
								</div>

								<p>If we tell the people about two years ago that Lamelo Ball will be in the run for rookie of the year, people will think that we are crazy and now he is making a strong case to be the ROY. Lamelo Ball by his last name “Ball” the average NBA viewer of the family and mostly his brother Liangelo and Lonzo and the infamous Lavar Ball, he has been famous for about six years making him famous he got a lot of cult following and he got a lot of haters. His junior career is an unstable road to the NBA, but he still goes third in the NBA draft last year and now he is candidate ROY and this is why. With the number of 15.7 points 5.9 rebounds 6.1 assist and also an impressive 1.6 steals for a rookie and averaging above the average field goal percentage which a lot of rookie tend to be inefficient making him the case for ROY.</p>

								<h2 style="text-align:center;">COACH OF THE YEAR</h2>
								<h2 style="text-align:center;">Monty Williams</h2>
								<div class="featured">
									<figure>
										<img src="images/GettyImages-1299206607.png">
										<figcaption>Runner up: Quin Synder, Tom Thibodeau</figcaption>
									</figure>
								</div>

								<p>Monty Williams is deserving to be the COY of he convert this team from not reaching the playoff for the last 10 years to be the candidate for the first seat in the west, also last year he bring the Phoenix Suns from the ten seats to the first just in one year which we think that is impossible within one year. Also the star player that is Devin Booker and the new edition from the beginning of this season a veteran player Chris Paul that he is bringing his experience to be the best team making the first seat in the west also we forget to tell the first in the whole NBA making it coach Monty Williams our COY.</p>

								<p>So that is our recap of our prediction of the NBA awards in the year 2020-2021 season and this our pick and also this is our pick and if you disagree just take it like a grain of salt and it’s okay to have your own opinion, that’s all thank you for reading it.</p>
